Based on mutability, Python objects are categorized into two types: mutable and immutable."],"metadata":{"id":"TNOsHFe_gaBr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6:- The mutability of lists and immutability of tuples in Python stems from their design and intended use cases. Here's a detailed explanation:\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **1. Purpose and Use Cases**\n","- **Lists** are designed to be versatile and allow modifications such as adding, removing, or changing elements. They are ideal for scenarios where the data changes frequently.\n","- **Tuples**, on the other hand, are designed to be lightweight and immutable. They are often used to represent fixed collections of items or as keys in dictionaries (since keys must be hashable and immutable).\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. Internal Implementation**\n","- **Lists:**\n","  - Internally, lists are implemented as dynamic arrays. This structure allows efficient modification because elements can be added, removed, or replaced without needing to create a new list.\n","  - Example: Modifying the value of an element directly changes the memory allocated for the list without creating a new object.\n","\n","  ```python\n","  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","  my_list[0] = 100  # Modifies the first element\n","  print(my_list)    # [100, 2, 3]\n","  ```\n","\n","- **Tuples:**\n","  - Tuples are implemented as a contiguous block of memory. Their immutability ensures that their contents remain consistent and hashable, making them suitable for scenarios like dictionary keys or sets.\n","  - Any operation that attempts to modify a tuple results in creating a new tuple, rather than modifying the existing one.\n","\n","  ```python\n","  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n","  my_tuple[0] = 100  # Raises TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **3. Hashability**\n","- **Lists:** Mutable objects, like lists, are not hashable because their contents can change, which would violate the consistency required for hashing. For example, the same list could hash to different values if modified.\n","  \n","  ```python\n","  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","  hash(my_list)  # TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n","  ```\n","\n","- **Tuples:** Tuples are immutable and hashable (as long as all their elements are also hashable). This property allows tuples to be used as dictionary keys or set elements.\n","\n","  ```python\n","  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n","  print(hash(my_tuple))  # Outputs a valid hash value\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **4. Practical Implications**\n","- **Lists:** Their mutability allows in-place modifications, which is efficient for operations that require frequent changes. However, this mutability can lead to side effects if the same list is shared across multiple parts of a program.\n","  \n","  ```python\n","  def modify_list(lst):\n","      lst.append(4)\n","\n","  my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n","  modify_list(my_list)\n","  print(my_list)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]\n","  ```\n","\n","- **Tuples:** Their immutability ensures stability and consistency, making them safer for use in scenarios where data integrity is critical or objects must not be modified accidentally.\n","\n","  ```python\n","  my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)\n","  # Safe from accidental modifications\n","  ```\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Conclusion**\n","- Lists are mutable to allow flexibility and easy manipulation of data.\n","- Tuples are immutable to provide consistency, hashability, and reduced memory overhead for fixed data.\n","\n","The choice between lists and tuples depends on your specific requirements—whether you need modifiable data or fixed, hashable collections."],"metadata":{"id":"4QWsHmUOgaGq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7:- In Python, `==` and `is` are two different operators used for comparison, but they serve distinct purposes.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **1. `==` Operator (Equality)**\n","- The `==` operator checks whether the **values** of two objects are equal.\n","- It compares the **contents** of the objects and evaluates to `True` if they are the same, even if the objects are stored in different memory locations.\n","\n","#### Example:\n","```python\n","x = [1, 2, 3]\n","y = [1, 2, 3]\n","print(x == y)  # True: The contents of x and y are the same\n","```\n","\n","#### Key Point:\n","Even if the objects are distinct (i.e., stored in different memory locations), `==` will return `True` if their contents are equal.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **2. `is` Operator (Identity)**\n","- The `is` operator checks whether two objects refer to the **same memory location** (i.e., whether they are the same object).\n","- It evaluates to `True` only if both variables point to the exact same object in memory.\n","\n","#### Example:\n","```python\n","x = [1, 2, 3]\n","y = [1, 2, 3]\n","print(x is y)  # False: x and y have the same contents but are different objects\n","```\n","\n","#### Key Point:\n","Even if two objects have the same contents, `is` will return `False` unless they are the same object in memory.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pXVDRQ9PgaKj"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8:- Logical operators in Python are used to perform logical operations on values (usually Boolean values) and determine the truthiness of expressions.

The program should keep asking the user for the password until the correct one is entered. The number of attempts is unknown and depends on the user's input.

If the number of attempts is unknown, a `while` loop provides the necessary flexibility.\n","\n","### **Other Scenarios for `while` Loop Suitability:**\n","1. **Waiting for a condition**: If a process depends on external factors, like waiting for a network response or a file to be available, you can use a `while` loop to keep checking until the condition is met.\n","2. **Game loops**: In video games, a `while` loop can be used to keep the game running until the user decides to quit, where the number of iterations (game cycles) is not predetermined.\n","3. **Real-time data monitoring**: Continuously monitoring a sensor or user activity in real-time until a specific event happens (e.g., monitoring temperature until it exceeds a threshold).\n","\n","In all of these cases, a `while` loop is more appropriate because it provides the flexibility to loop indefinitely until the condition is met, without needing a predefined number of iterations."],"metadata":{"id":"U2lVZKrLaEfy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["                                                                PRACTICAL ANSWERS"],"metadata":{"id":"KB96azrGagRi"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["1. print(\"Hello, World!\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ftvFJam8iPA0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736786460412,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":443,"user":{"displayName":"pragati tripathi","userId":"14624923898521269213"}},"outputId":"8176664c-cef2-4c08-b569-44e97b6b0a6a"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Hello, World!\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["2. name = \"PRAGATI TRIPATHI\"\n","age = 20\n","\n","print(\"Name:\", name)\n","print(\"Age:\", age)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"sjd3_etgiogm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736786634061,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":364,"user":{"displayName":"pragati tripathi","userId":"14624923898521269213"}},"outputId":"9abf7516-4980-4f16-93c4-fb93085c4cc0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Name: PRAGATI TRIPATHI\n","Age: 20\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["3. import keyword\n","\n","# Get the list of all Python keywords\n","python_keywords = keyword.kwlist\n","\n","# Print each keyword\n","print(\"Predefined keywords in Python:\")\n","for kw in python_keywords:\n","    print(kw)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"nieLCNSViokL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736786752786,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":442,"user":{"displayName":"pragati tripathi","userId":"14624923898521269213"}},"outputId":"02ac840c-81f8-47f2-e495-38fea80275b6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Predefined keywords in Python:\n","False\n","None\n","True\n","and\n","as\n","assert\n","async\n","await\n","break\n","class\n","continue\n","def\n","del\n","elif\n","else\n","except\n","finally\n","for\n","from\n","global\n","if\n","import\n","in\n","is\n","lambda\n","nonlocal\n","not\n","or\n","pass\n","raise\n","return\n","try\n","while\n","with\n","yield\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["4. import keyword\n","\n","# Get user input\n","word = input(\"Enter a word to check if it's a Python keyword: \")\n","\n","# Check if the word is a keyword\n","if keyword.iskeyword(word):\n","    print(f\"'{word}' is a Python keyword.\")\n","else:\n","    print(f\"'{word}' is not a Python keyword.\")\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"O8k4p_mTiook","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1736843968192,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":28204,"user":{"displayName":"pragati tripathi","userId":"14624923898521269213"}},"outputId":"6f36010f-0962-4378-e835-7a62fd5d9807"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Enter a word to check if it's a Python keyword: hello\n","'hello' is not a Python keyword.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["5. #
